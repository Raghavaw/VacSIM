# VacSIM: Learning Effective Strategies for COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution using Reinforcement Learning
This folder contains all the necessary code and environment for implementing our VacSIM model. This consists of 4 folders and respective README.md markdown filed with further descriptions : 
* gym-vaccine : This is the sub-model 1 (ACKTR) as described in our paper, and contains a self-described RL enviroment implemented using Open-AI gym and a  ready-to-run demo ipynb notebook (google colab compatiable).
* contextual-bandits-vaccine : This is the sub-model 2 as described in our paper, and a test folder which code used for cleaning and consolidating the input data used as well a walkthrought of using [space-bandits package](https://pypi.org/project/space-bandits/)  and a ready-to-run demo ipynb notebook (google colab compatiable).
* VacSIM DataSets :  Containing the input and output dataset used. 
* bayesian-network-seir : This folder contains all the code and necessary files used for SEIR model and for Bayesian Networks
