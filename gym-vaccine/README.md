This folder contains the code for `vd-v0`, the first version of an OpenAI gym environment developed for the Vaccine Distribution scenario. A detailed explanation of the technicalities
can be referred to from our paper on VacSIM.

## Installation 
1. Go to the *gym-vaccine* folder and run ```pip install -e```. This will install the gym environment. 
2. To use the environment, run the following commands:
```import gym
import gym_vaccine
env = gym.make('vd-v0')
```

You can now use the environment to train your model efficiently. 

Feel free to check out and the code and tweak the hyperparameters. Do open PRs/Issuess in case you find something interesting. Happy Hacking :)
